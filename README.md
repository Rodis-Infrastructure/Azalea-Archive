## Azalea Moderation Bot

This file serves as documentation for the Roblox Discord's moderation bot.

## Configuration

For a full example of the configuration, you can view the [`example.toml`](config/guilds/example.toml) file in the
repository

### Message Deletion on Ban

The `deleteMessageSecondsOnBan` field determines the period of time (in second) over which the banned user's messages
will be deleted. If set to `0`, the bot will not delete any messages.

```toml
deleteMessageSecondsOnBan = 0
```

### Allowed Proof Channels

Require all message links in infraction evidence to be from specific channels. If set to an empty array, all channels
will be allowed.

```toml
allowedProofChannelIds = ["channel-id"]
```

### Channel Configuration

The `channels` section allows you to configure which channels the bot will perform certain actions in.

```toml
[channels]
banRequestQueue = "channel-id"
muteRequestQueue = "channel-id"
```

### Custom Emojis

The `emojis` section enables you to customize the emojis used for the bot's responses. The fields listed below are the
emojis that can currently be configured for different types of responses.

```toml
[emojis]
success = "ðŸ‘Œ"
error = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
quickMute30 = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
quickMute60 = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
purgeMessages = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
approveRequest = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
denyRequest = "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
```

### Ephemeral Responses

The `ephemeralResponses` section controls the behavior of the bot's interaction responses. If enabled, all interaction
responses used outside excluded categories/channels will have an ephemeral response, even if
an `InteractionResponseType` is specified.

```toml
[ephemeralResponses]
enabled = true
excludedCategories = []
excludedChannels = []
```

### Confirmation Messages

When specified, confirmation messages will be sent in the specified channel whenever a moderation action is carried out
outside said channel.

```toml
confirmationChannel = "channel-id"
```

### User Flags

When the configuration is set, the `/info` command now includes the names of the flags associated with the user in its
response.

```toml
[[userFlags]]
name = "flag-name"
roleIds = ["role-id"]
```

### Role and Group Configuration

The `roles` and `groups` sections allow you to configure which roles have access to specific message components and
modals.

- `guildStaff` - Prevents the user from being given an infraction.
- `manageInfractions` - Allows the user to modify or delete any infraction.
- `viewModerationActivity` - Allows the user to view the number of infractions a staff member has given out.
- `manageBanRequests` - Allows the user to approve or deny ban requests.
- `manageMuteRequests` - Allows the user to approve or deny mute requests.

#### Role Configuration

```toml
[[roles]]
id = "role-id"
guildStaff = false
manageInfractions = false
viewModerationActivity = false
manageBanRequests = false
manageMuteRequests = false
selections = []
buttons = []
modals = []
reactions = []
```

#### Role Group Configuration

```toml
[[groups]]
guildStaff = false
manageInfractions = false
viewModerationActivity = false
roleIds = []
selectMenus = []
buttons = []
modals = []
reactions = []
```

### Logging Configuration

The `logging` section controls all the logging events. Below is a list of supported logging events (excluded
category/channel configuration does not apply to moderation infraction logging):

* `interactionUsage` - Triggered when an interaction is used, whether it is a command, button, modal, or select menu.
* `infractions` - Triggered when a user is given an infraction.
* `messages` - Triggered when a message is updated, deleted, or deleted in bulk.

```toml
[logging]
enabled = true
excludedCategories = []
excludedChannels = []

[logging.loggingEvent]
enabled = true
channelId = "channel-id"
excludedCategories = []
excludedChannels = []
```
