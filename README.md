## Azalea Moderation Bot

This file serves as documentation for the Roblox Discord's moderation bot.

## Configuration

For a full example of the configuration, you can view the [`example.yaml`](config/guilds/example.yaml) file in the
repository

### Message Deletion on Ban

The `deleteMessageSecondsOnBan` field determines the period of time (in second) over which the banned user's messages
will be deleted. If set to `0`, the bot will not delete any messages.

```yaml
deleteMessageSecondsOnBan: 0
```

### Custom Emojis

The `emojis` section enables you to customize the emojis used for the bot's responses. The fields listed below are the
emojis that can currently be configured for different types of responses.

```yaml
emojis:
    success: "ðŸ‘Œ"
    error: "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
    quickMute30: "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
    quickMute60: "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
    purgeMessages: "<:emoji-name:emoji-id>"
```

### Ephemeral Responses

The `ephemeralResponses` section controls the behavior of the bot's interaction responses. If enabled, all interaction
responses used outside excluded categories/channels will have an ephemeral response, even if
an `InteractionResponseType` is specified.

```yaml
ephemeralResponses:
  enabled: true
  excludedCategories: []
  excludedChannels: []
```

### Confirmation Messages

When specified, confirmation messages will be sent in the specified channel whenever a moderation action is carried out
outside said channel.

```yaml
confirmationChannel: "channel-id"
```

### User Flags

When the configuration is set, the `/info` command now includes the names of the flags associated with the user in its
response.

```yaml
userFlags:
  - name: "flag-name"
    roleIds:
      - "role-id"
```

### Role and Group Configuration

The `roles` and `groups` sections allow you to configure which roles have access to specific message components and
modals.

- `guildStaff` - Prevents the user from being given an infraction.
- `manageInfractions` - Allows the user to modify or delete any infraction.
- `viewModerationActivity` - Allows the user to view the number of infractions a staff member has given out.

#### Role Configuration

```yaml
roles:
  - id: "role-id"
    guildStaff: false
    manageInfractions: false
    viewModerationActivity: false
    selections: []
    buttons: []
    modals: []
    reactions: []
```

#### Role Group Configuration

```yaml
groups:
  - guildStaff: false
    manageInfractions: false
    viewModerationActivity: false
    roleIds: []
    selectMenus: []
    buttons: []
    modals: []
    reactions: []
```

### Logging Configuration

The `logging` section controls all the logging events. Below is a list of supported logging events (excluded
category/channel configuration does not apply to moderation infraction logging):

* `interactionUsage` - Triggered when an interaction is used, whether it is a command, button, modal, or select menu.
* `infractions` - Triggered when a user is given an infraction.
* `messages` - Triggered when a message is updated, deleted, or deleted in bulk.

```yaml
logging:
  enabled: true
  excludedCategories: []
  excludedChannels: []

  loggingEvent:
      enabled: true
      channelId: "channel-id"
      excludedCategories: []
      excludedChannels: []
```
